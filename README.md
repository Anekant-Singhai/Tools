# Recon/bug_bounty_recon_hackerone.py

## What It Does
Tired of figuring out what's eligible, which subdomains to tackle, or how to conduct recon? Look no further! This script takes a CSV file from your HackerOne profile and performs the following tasks:

- Extracts the list of eligible for bounty items and sorts them by URL, application, and more.
- Performs a domain scan, providing the status of whether the domain is up or not using a custom HTTPX tool.
- Submits active domains to a subdomain finder, categorizing subdomains by their function, such as API subdomains, auth subdomains, developer subdomains, and more.

**Note:** It requires a Chaos API key, which is free to obtain.

## How to Use
Simply run the script, and it will prompt you for two inputs:
1. Chaos API key
2. A CSV file from your HackerOne scope

Sit back and relax!

This script lets you add valid login credentials to your wordlist in between entries, helping you avoid being blocked.

## Where to Use
When there's a rate limit for a certain number of incorrect login attempts and it's reset by a correct login, you can bypass it by creating a wordlist with correct login credentials.
